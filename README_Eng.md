# Job Blacklist for Programmers

:snail:I'am also one of the spectators，the truth behinds should be judged by yourselves. I just simply collect some links, please don't be a troll even if you don't like it. Welcome to follow me at [Weibo](http://weibo.com/woniuppp) and propose [issues](https://github.com/shengxinjing/programmer-job-blacklist/issues) to participate and maintain this list.


Some recent events have made me realised that some of our associates are notoriou, which needs to be recorded to remind others when recruiting.



### Foreword

Thanks for [issues](https://github.com/shengxinjing/programmer-job-blacklist/issues/20)'s reminding

At first, every programmer, every company has its improper places. However, if we excessive focus on these improper places, this black list will be meaningless. Taking these things as examples

1. [Shijijiayuan](http://www.jiayuan.com/) considers the white hat hackers are illegal
    * Although this is the [reason](https://www.zhihu.com/question/47775182) why I created this repo, but they didn't withhold or pay no wages.

2. The shares that the founder said, that is what the individual should fight for.
    * Also do not withhold or pay no wages
    * Just remember to keep your eyes open, working with the partner is not just writing code.
3. Huawei 'cleaned up' employees over the age of 34 is in accordance with the contract, and gives compensation.
    * Large companies need to be renewed periodically, so layoffs have no problems. A company that doesn’t lay off people will close up sooner or later.
    * Huawei also didn't withholding employees's salary
    * It's just I personally feel that because of this, I don’t want to work for Huawei. That's it, just afraid being dismissed when I'm 34.
4. Some things should be remembered

### Choosing companies

* Suggesting that everyone should do some research when you are choosing a company http://tianyancha.com , and if you found some issues just ask the person in charge in case of suffering losses

### 当技术合伙人建议
* 选自[冯大辉的微博](http://weibo.com/1577826897/EwLWXoxtG) 只写代码和当合伙人，还是有很大差别的，我觉得上面的建议很中肯


### 最后

* 最后说一下心得，竟然还有希望 GitHub 处理这个 repo，原因是想维护github这份纯净，还把 GitHub 被墙和我挂钩，我真是醉了，就像一群待宰的羔羊，心想着只要老实一点，宰的就是别人不是我一样

* 我只是记录一下自己看到过的事件，我自己下次换工作的时候防止踩坑，仅此而已
* 我也没有那么愤世嫉俗，比如我以后换工作，还是会考虑百度阿里的，但是会避免上面出现的坑，比如百度无人车我就不去啦，阿里的其他很多部门还是很棒的，希望到时候不会因为这个名单把我 pass 吧:joy:

> 求star，支持我继续把这个名单维护下去,谢谢支持
